        <h5 class="fw-bold">1. I just created an account. What should I do first?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          After signing up, choose whether you are here to find performers or to manage your own
          performer presence. If you are a performer, go to your profile to add your act details,
          photo, and media from past events.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h5 class="fw-bold">2. How do I appear in the performer directory?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          On your profile, make sure "Show me in the performer directory" is turned on. Then fill
          in your act type, location, and bio. Once saved, you will show up in the directory for
          event planners to discover.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h5 class="fw-bold">3. How do I upload photos or videos of past events?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          From your profile, open "My promo gallery". There you can upload photos or short videos
          from your computer. These media items will appear in the "Past events" section of your
          profile and on the public performer page.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h5 class="fw-bold">4. How do I find performers for my event?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          Use the "Find performers" link in the header to open the directory. You can search by
          name, act type (for example magician, DJ, comedian), and location. Click a performer to
          see their full profile, media, and contact information.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h5 class="fw-bold">5. What is the difference between a performer and a non-performer account?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          Performer accounts appear in the public directory and show act details, availability, and
          media. Non-performer accounts are for people who only want to browse and contact talent;
          they can still have a profile and avatar but are not listed in the directory.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h5 class="fw-bold">6. I am a manager. How do I adjust someone elses profile?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          Open the performer from the directory and use the manager-only buttons to edit their
          profile or update their manager status. You can also remove inappropriate media from their
          gallery if needed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-2">
        <h5 class="fw-bold">7. Who can see my information?</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
          Basic performer details (name, act type, location, bio, and media) are visible to anyone
          who opens your public performer page from the directory. Manager-only actions are only
          visible to users with manager access.
